# FizzBuzz - A JavaScript Exercise

## Description
This is a practice/demonstration repository to practice JavaScript by creating an answer to the classic coding challenge - FizzBuzz.

The basic FizzBuzz challenge is to print numbers from 1 to a limit, however for numbers divisible by 3, the program should print `Fizz` in place of the number, and for multiples of 5 it should print `Buzz`.  For multiples of 3 and 5, the program should print `FizzBuzz`.  An example output from 1 to 15 would appear below:

```ruby
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
The specs given for this exercise stat a JavaScrip program that iterates from 1 to 1000 and returns either the number or Fizz/Buzz/FizzBuzz respectively.
